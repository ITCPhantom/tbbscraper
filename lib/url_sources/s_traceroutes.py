"""Perform a traceroute (using 'paris-traceroute', which must be in
the PATH and must be invokeable by an unprivileged user) to a
specified set of destinations, through a specified set of proxies.
There are three mandatory arguments: a "location specifications"
config file, a "traceroute destinations" config file, and an output
directory (which will be created if it doesn't exist), in that order.
The location specifications file has the same format that `capture`
uses.  The traceroute destinations config file is simply a list of
hostnames, one per line, possibly followed by an IPv4 address in
parentheses (which overrides any attempt to look up that host's DNS
name); # anywhere introduces a comment; non-ASCII domain names may
either be written human-readably in UTF-8, or IDNA-coded.  Only one
traceroute runs at a time for each proxy.  In addition to the
destinations listed in the file, this program will also carry out
traceroutes via each proxy to each DNS server configured for that proxy.

Output is to individual files named output_dir/YYYY-MM-DD.N/LOCATION/DNS.NAME
(regardless of input syntax, SITENAME will be human-readable).  YYY-MM-DD.N
is unique for each run of this program."""
